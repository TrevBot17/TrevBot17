- 👋 Hi, I’m @TrevBot17
- 👀 I’m interested in all things data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in the University of Michigan Masters of Applied Data Science (MADS) program, expecting to graduate in December 2022.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me learn Python, Pandas, GitHub, SQL or data science.
